    "## 1. What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy can be seen as the foundation of mathematical calculations in Python. It provides a user-friendly way for the users to represent numerical data as lists or matrices objects and do calculations on these objects. For example, let's say you have a list of numbers ```[1, 2, 3]``` and want to calculate the mean of the list, then Numpy provides a simple syntax to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of it's ease of use and high performance, NumPy has become the basis for virtually every data science package that exists. In this notebook, we will demonstrate some of the most important functionality that NumPy has to offer, and provide you with some excercises to help you learn how to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, exercises are given that are designed such that they are similar to the examples provided. In the case that you are really lost or want to check your answer: you can find your answers [here](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.md).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, you can use NumPy arrays to represent:\n",
